# Examples

Here you'll find an example client implementation, together with a fitting example server implementation.
The server could be considered to be usable for real projects though.

## Usage:
1. Start the server.
2. Start two `client.py`'s, one with no args, one with the -s flag (the sender).

3. Admire the messages being sent & recieved *securely*.
