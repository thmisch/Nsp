implement a way for messages to be stored on the server side.

a kex will be sent by user a to user b
user b is offline, so the sever thread from a puts it in a's USR packet at 'queue'

User b connects,
serverthread b goes through all users in cache, looks at every kex in there, looks for TO == b.
if TO is found, the respective packets will be sent out.
if nothing is found, an empty or error dict will be sent, to notify the client.
